    "### Source finding (Haywood et al 2021)\n",
    "We used the pybdsf source finder (Mohan & Rafferty 2015) to locate and characterise components in the primary beam corrected COSMOS image, and the XMM-LSS mosaic. Briefly, pybdsf works by using a sliding box to estimate the local background noise (σlocal) as a function of position in the image. It then locates pixels in the image whose brightness exceeds the local background noise by some factor (in this case 5σlocal). A flood-fill algorithm is then used to identify islands of contiguous emission down to some secondary threshold, in this case 3σlocal. These islands are then iteratively fitted with point and 2D Gaussian components, and pybdsf then attempts to group point and Gaussian components into sources, based on the brightness of the pixels between components in relation to the secondary threshold, and a separation criterion based on the measured sizes of the components. A catalogue describing the properties of the components and source groupings is then exported, and this raw output forms our Level-0 catalogue products. The Level-0 catalogues derived from the robust 0.0 images contain 9,915 and 20,397 components in COSMOS and XMM-LSS respectively. The steps in the sections that follow describe the modifications and addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note since we are comparing default outputs of these functions, we do not want to look at the level 1 catalogoues as these have been altered through visul insepection."
